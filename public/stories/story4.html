					 As well as people making the enormously brave decision to quit smoking, I hope this reaches those who are new to their quit programs, and those who are now getting comfortable and familiar with their smoke-free lives.<br/><br/>Anyone on About.com&#39;s <a href="http://forums.about.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?nav&#61;messages&amp;webtag&#61;ab-quitsmoking" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">smoking cessation forum</a> between 2006 and summer 2007 may remember me. My name is James. This year I turn 22 (please do not let my young age fool you) and I am from southern England.<h3>I began smoking as a very young teen.</h3>I had low self-esteem and despite knowing the dangers, I started smoking to fit in. It&#39;s a common story, played out the world over. For some reason, a rolled-up paper with tobacco and <a href="http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/addiction/g/nicotine.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">nicotine</a> inside is supposed to make you popular, or confident, or cool. It doesn&#39;t.<br/><br/>By the age of 15, my addiction was so strong I was smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. Soon my ex-smoker parents found out (my dad once worked for the company that made Marlboro cigarettes, and each of my parents smoked between 40 and 60 a day in their early twenties!) and despite their intense disappointment, I continued.

					 It was my rebellion, along with with alcohol, drugs, skipping school and fighting. I had so many internal issues going on, I thought acting out would distract those I loved (and myself) from them. Smoking was the main distraction though, because it soon became all I thought about, day and night.<br/><br/>When I was 19 years old, I was smoking up to 30 cigarettes a day at University, and with a night out, it could easily reach 40 a day. I switched to a stronger brand, yet still smoked more and was in constant pain. A University doctor told me I had the lungs of a 40-year-old smoker and I wasn&#39;t even 20. Yet still, the strongest part of my addiction lay within the need to feel &#34;adult.&#34; I felt smoking made me mature. How wrong I was.<br/><br/>I remember moving my dormitory room around so that my bed was next to my desk. First thing in the morning, all I had to do was sit up in bed and I was at my desk with a cigarette checking out the news on the Internet. If I didn&#39;t have my cig within a moment of waking I felt the veins in my arms and legs throb -- I <em>needed</em> that cigarette. What a disgusting thought, but one we can all relate to, I&#39;m sure.<h3>My rebellion was over but I was left a heavy smoker.</h3>I tried to quit in 2005 and lasted a week when the doctor told me how bad I might feel (I already did) from <a href="http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/cravingsandurges/a/withdrawal.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">nicotine withdrawal</a>. I tried again in 2006. My second quit was unsuccessful but the best attempt so far, as I joined this wonderful forum. However, within a few weeks away from the forum I was back to 30 cigarettes a day.<br/><br/>As the year 2007 started, I was looking forward to turning 21. There was to be a big party thrown in my honor, I was getting set for a career, school was going better than ever and I was engaged to my wonderful boyfriend Ashley. What should have been a great time of transition ended up as a painful and demoralizing (there are no other words) period that I think will always be known as the worst months and year of my life.<h3>I was diagnosed with <a href="http://cancer.about.com/od/testicularcancer/p/testicularpro.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">testicular cancer</a> just before my 21st birthday.</h3><p>I spent months dealing with treatment and still am, with ongoing recovery. I should stress, this was almost certainly not linked to smoking; however, cancer is cancer, no matter the cause, and it is no easier to deal with, whatever the circumstance. The negative impact of the word &#34;cancer&#34; feels like an immediate death sentence regardless of the cause, type or stage. It is a word that embodies death, misery, suffering and, very often, regret.<br/><br/>The fear that I could eventually be told I have <a href="http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/lungcancer/a/lungcancer.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5">lung cancer</a> is too much to even begin to imagine and was all the reason I finally needed to get rid of this horrible smoking habit. The thought of being told I had <a href="http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/respiratorydiseasecopd/a/emphysema.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6">emphysema</a> or cancer because of a habit I was addicted to would be too much. I would not be able to cope.</p><p>I had quit smoking in March 2007 shortly before my diagnosis, however, the occasional cigarette crept in here and there. On 14th July, 2007, I vowed never to smoke another cigarette. I am proud to say that I have stuck to that vow ever since.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that I attribute almost 6 months without cigarettes not to willpower, but to exhaustion. I was exhausted from smoking. I was tired of the need, the cravings, the smell, the taste. I was tired of the looks others gave me, the shame I felt, the pain inflicted on those I loved ... the list is endless. I was so tired of smoking, I didn&#39;t need willpower. I truly believe the secret to a successful quit lies in the <em>desire</em> to quit. No quit program will work if you don&#39;t really want to stop smoking.<br/><br/>You don&#39;t want to smoke? Then don&#39;t!  It&#39;s as simple as that. Is it tough? Yes!  But if your desire to quit is greater than your need to smoke, you will succeed.</p><h3>We all deserve a smoke-free life.</h3>No matter what triggers us to quit smoking or spurs us on, we deserve the health and happiness that being smoke-free provides. Cessation <em>does</em> get easier and very quickly. It&#39;s a wonderful existence without nicotine addiction.  If you still struggle with cravings months after you&#39;ve quit, then I believe you need to re-examine your <a href="http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/shouldiquit/a/whyquit.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7">reasons for quitting</a> in the first place.<h3>I hope my story inspires someone.</h3>Despite my young age, 8 years of smoking took 2 years of trying to quit and a diagnosis of cancer to wake me up.<br/><br/>I leave you all with a final message:<br/><br/>Do what you can <em>now</em> to decide your fate. Stop smoking while you can <em>before</em> it&#39;s too late. You decided to smoke, no matter the excuse, and <em>you</em> have to choose to stop, no matter the reason. Don&#39;t wait for a profound reason; <em>any</em> reason will do.
