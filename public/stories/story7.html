<font size="+1">It was early on February 25th.&nbsp;   Sean Marsee smiled a tired smile at his sister, pointed his index finger skyward  and an hour later, at age 19, Sean Marsee was dead.&nbsp; Just ten months earlier, Sean, an 18 year-old high school senior and star of the school track team, was just a weekend away from competing in the state track finals, and a month from graduation.<br><br>It was then that Sean opened his mouth and showed his mother an ugly sore on his tongue.&nbsp;   His mother, a registered nurse, took one look and felt her heart sink.<br><br>A user of  smokeless chewing tobacco and snuff since age 12, rarely was Sean 		without a dip.&nbsp;  Living from nicotine fix to nicotine fix, he went through a can of snuff every day and a half.&nbsp;  When Sean's mother finally discovered his secret she hit the roof.&nbsp;  She tried explaining just how hazardous that tobacco was for him, smoke or no smoke, but Sean refused to believe her.<br><br>He argued that other boys on the track team were dipping.  He argued that his coach knew and didn't seem to care.&nbsp;  He argued that high profile sports stars were using and marketing smokeless tobacco.&nbsp;   How could it be dangerous, he pleaded.&nbsp; In the end, his mother simply dropped the subject.<br><br>But now, an angry red spot with a hard white core, about the size of a 				half-dollar, was being worn by his tongue.&nbsp;  "I'm sorry, Sean," said			Dr. Carl	Hook, the throat specialist.&nbsp;  "It doesn't look good.&nbsp;    We'll have to do a biopsy."&nbsp; Sean was stunned.<br><br>Aside from his addiction to nicotine, he didn't drink, he didn't smoke and he took excellent care of his body;  watching his diet, lifting weights and running five miles a day, six months a year.&nbsp; Now this.&nbsp;  How could it be?&nbsp;  "But I didn't know snuff could be that bad for you," Sean said.<br>
<br>"I'm afraid  we'll have to remove that part of your tongue, Sean," Dr. Hook said.&nbsp;   The high school senior was silent.&nbsp;   "Can I still run in the state track meet this weekend?" he finally asked.&nbsp;   "And graduate next month?"&nbsp;  Dr. Hook nodded.<br>
<br>On May 16th, Dr. Hook performed the operation.&nbsp;  More of Sean's tongue		had to be removed than was anticipated.&nbsp; Worse yet, the biopsy results were	back and the tumor tested positive for cancer.&nbsp;   Arrangements were made for Sean to see a radiation therapist.  But before therapy began, a newly swollen lymph node was found in Sean's neck.&nbsp;    It was an ominous sign that the cancer had spread.&nbsp;   Radical neck surgery had now become necessary.<br><br>Dr. Hood gently recommended to Sean that he undergo the severest option: removing the lower jaw on the right side, as well as all lymph nodes, muscles and blood vessels except for his artery.&nbsp;   There might be some sinking, he explained, but the chin would support the general planes of the face.<br>
<br>His mother began to cry.&nbsp;  Sean was being asked to approve his own			mutilation.&nbsp;   This was a teenager who was so concerned about his appearance that he'd even swallow his dip rather than be caught spitting tobacco juice. <br><br>They sat in silence for ten minutes.&nbsp;   Then, dimly, she heard him say, "Not the jawbone.&nbsp; Don't take the jawbone."<br><br>"Okay, Sean, " Dr. Hook said softly.&nbsp; "But the rest; that's the least we should do."&nbsp;  	On June 20th Sean underwent his second surgery.&nbsp;  It lasted eight hours.<br><br>At school, 150 students and teachers assembled in June to honor their most outstanding athlete.&nbsp;   Sean could not be there to receive their award. &nbsp;   His Coach and his assistant came to Sean's home to present their gift, a walnut plaque.&nbsp;   They tried not to stare at the huge scar that ran like a railroad track from their star performer's earlobe to his breastbone.&nbsp;    Smiling crookedly out of the other side of his mouth, Sean thanked them.<br>
<br>With five weeks of healing and radiation therapy behind him, in August Sean		greeted Dr. Hood with enthusiasm, plainly happy to be alive.&nbsp; Miraculously, Sean had snapped back.&nbsp;  "He really believes his superb physical condition is going to lick it," Dr.  Hook thought.&nbsp; "Let's hope he's going to win this race too."<br><br>But in October Sean started having headaches.&nbsp;   A CAT scan showed twin		tentacles of fresh malignancy, one snaking down his back, the other curling under the base of his brain.&nbsp;  In November, Sean underwent surgery for the third time.&nbsp;   It was the jawbone operation he had feared - and more.<br>
<br>After 10 hours on the operating room table, he had four huge drains coming from a foot long crescent wound, a breathing tube sticking out of a hole in his throat, a feeding tube through his nose, and two tubes in his arm veins.&nbsp;   Sean looked at his mother as if to say, "My God, Mom, I didn't know it was going to hurt like this."<br><br>The Marsees brought Sean home for Christmas.&nbsp;  Even then, he remained optimistic until that day in January when he found new lumps in the left side of his cheek.&nbsp;  His mother answered the phone when the hospital called with the results of the biopsy.&nbsp;  Sean knew the news was bad by her silent tears as she listened. <br><br>When she hung up, he was in her arms, and for the first time since the awful nightmare started, grit-tough Sean Marsee began to sob.&nbsp;    After a few minutes, he straightened and said, "Don't worry.&nbsp;   I'm going to be fine." &nbsp;  Like the winning runner he was, he still had faith in his finishing kick.<br><br>One day Sean confessed to his mother that he still craved his snuff.&nbsp;   "I catch myself thinking," he said, "I'll just reach  over and have a dip."&nbsp;   Then he added that he wished he could visit the high-school locker room to show the athletes "what you look like when you use it." &nbsp; His appearance, he  knew would be persuasive.&nbsp;  A classmate who had come to see him fainted dead away.
<br><br>
Shortly before Sean's death he told his mother that there must be a reason that God decided not to save him.&nbsp;    Sean's mother believes that Sean's		legacy is in having his story spread and hopefully "keeping other kids from dying."&nbsp; When Sean became unable to speak, a friend asked him if there was anything he wanted to share with other young athletes.&nbsp;   With pencil in hand Sean wrote, "Don't dip snuff."
<br><br>
On the morning of February 25th, Sean Marsee, age nineteen, exhaled his last breath.
