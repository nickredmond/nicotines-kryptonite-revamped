<p>That was One Year Ago Today. As I sit here now on day 364 days quit, I look back to who I was, what I was and I am sad, I am happy. I am sad to think what a waste of 15 years were and what my priorities were. I am happy because tomorrow I will have been nicotine free for one year! Yes One Year!</p>
<p>One year is a damn nice start, just 14 more to go to make up for the time I spent wasting my life on a can of shit. I know I am not healed. I know I can not have just one. I know I owe my quit to this site and the great people that give their time here daily and those who just pass through. I know I am quit for today and the odds look damn fine for being quit tomorrow as well.</p>
<p>Tomorrow; I rarely look at tomorrow in respect to my quit, but today I feel confident about tomorrow. Tomorrow I will be quit, I will be quit for one full year and you newbie’s may be asking how we make it a year; we do it like you, one day at a time. Sure, in the beginning it’s hard as hell but it does get better.</p>
<p><b>1 Year Recap:</b></p>
<p>Day 1 – 4 Pure hell on earth – but not as bad as I feared<br>
Day 5 – 13 Days each got better and feeling ok, just a bit of fog<br>
Day 14 See Day 1- 4.<br>
Day 15 The best day so far in my quit to that point<br>
Day 16 – 29 Cruise control quitting<br>
Day 30 QUIT<br>
Day 31 – 69 Found that helping others helped me. “Pass it Forward”<br>
Day 70 – 78 The Funk, just bored with quitting<br>
Day 79 – 99 Fast track to the Hall of Fame and feeling good, still having some craves<br>
Day 100 No way to describe your HOF day. Happy, proud and worth the effort<br>
Day 100 – 199 Flew buy and enjoyed being a “vet”<br>
Day 200 Hit the 2nd floor and feeling great<br>
Day 220 Welded the door closed – No more craves at all.<br>
Day 300 Hit the 3rd floor – So cool<br>
Day 365 Only tomorrow will tell – One day at a time</p>
<p>One thing I can tell you is the only wear mark on my jeans pocket is from Orbit gum.</p>
<p>Yes you can quit, you Can Beat This Addiction. Yes it is damn hard work for a while and there is a new trap or trick around every corner for a while but it can be done, just look around this place. You will find that the car will start without a dip in, the lawn mower will still cut the grass, the deer will still love you and the fish will jump into your boat. 97% of the people in North America do all these things their whole life without even thinking about a dip and so will you soon to. Are you ready? Are you really ready to save your life, for you? I dare you to sit here like me 364 days from today and tell us what your first year without dip was like. Can you do it? Will you do it?</p>
